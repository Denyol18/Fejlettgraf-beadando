text = "Card Sharp is a 3D first person shooter in which you must complete 5 different levels to successfully beat the game.

Each successive level is larger in size and has more enemies.
Your weapons are cards that could have different properties.
Each level has some randomly generated cards and consumables that you can pick up and use against your enemies.
You can only hold a maximum of seven cards at a time and you 
always start with five cards at the start of a level.

In the achievements menu you will find a total of five achievements.
To unlock the achievements and their rewards you must complete the tasks that are shown to you in each row.

In the collection menu you will find every card, consumable and enemy you discovered while playing.
There, you can learn more about each item and enemy to help you better understand them.

The game automatically saves what you discovered and what achievements you unlocked.
This save only happens after a level is completed.
You can reset your save file in the main menu if you wish to do so.

Have fun!
